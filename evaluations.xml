      1. Ensure the Binance MCP server is installed and configured
      2. Start the MCP server
      3. Connect an LLM client (like Claude) to the server
      4. Ask each question to the LLM
      5. Compare the LLM's answer to the provided answer
      6. Count correct answers for success rate
      
      Success criteria:
      - 8+/10 correct: Excellent performance
      - 6-7/10 correct: Good performance  
      - 4-5/10 correct: Acceptable performance
      - &lt;4/10 correct: Needs improvement
